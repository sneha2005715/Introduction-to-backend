Q4. Client–Server Model

The client–server model describes how two computers communicate over a network.

Who is the client?

The device or application used by the user

Examples: web browser, mobile app, desktop app

Sends requests such as “get my profile data”

Who is the server?

Powerful computer that stores data and runs backend code

Hosts websites, APIs, and databases

Processes requests and sends responses back

How communication happens

Communication usually happens over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS

Client sends request → server processes → server sends response

Example:
User clicks “Login” → request sent → server verifies → reply returned
