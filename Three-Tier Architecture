Q5. Three-Tier Architecture

Three-tier architecture divides an application into three separated layers so that each layer has a specific responsibility.

1. Presentation Layer (Frontend/UI)

What the user sees

Handles design and user interaction

Built using HTML, CSS, JS, React, Angular etc.

2. Application (Business) Layer

Contains business logic and rules

Processes inputs from UI

Validates data and applies conditions

Often implemented using backend languages (Node.js, Java, Python etc.)

3. Data Layer

Handles storage and retrieval of data

Databases like MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL

Manages backups and indexing

Why is this architecture used?

Makes application easier to maintain

Each layer can be changed independently

Improves security (database not directly exposed to user)

Supports scalability and performance
